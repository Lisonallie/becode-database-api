### Becode Database API

#### What it is
I was assigned a project to create an API using a MySQL database. The end result works something like a Notes app. Based on which file you use, you are able to Create, Delete, Update, List, or Get notes.

#### Objectives
The objectives of the project were to
1. Learn how to create and use an API
2. Learn how to use MySQL databases
3. Learn the difference between SQL and NoSQL
4. Learn what CRUD is
5. Understand HTTP request types

#### Must-have features
1. Creating notes for example: HOST/addnote/TITLE
2. Notes are accessed by TITLE for creation, showing, editing and deleting
3. Updating notes
4. Getting a list of all the notes
5. Getting the text of one note
6. Deleting a note
7. Use a HTTP(S) GET to retreive data, POST request for adding, POST requests for updating, DELETE requests for deleting ....

- Write the PHP code for creating a note using the ?title=SOMETHING syntax
- Test it using https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install
- Once finished, show it to at least 2 OTHER juniors (so in total you will have had 8 DIFFERENT people who saw your progress, then show the responsible party)
- They write a SHORT review giving at least 2 comments on your code
- Choose what order you want to add Delete/List/Update/Get Note code files after this.

#### How to use
My database API has
